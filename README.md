# Agent Development Kit (ADK) Workshop

## Introduction
The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a powerful framework for building, testing, and deploying intelligent agentic applications. This workshop will guide you through the core concepts of ADK, from creating a single agent with basic tools to building complex, multi-agent systems. You'll learn how to equip your agents with a variety of tools, integrate with external services using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and orchestrate sophisticated workflows. We'll also explore the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**, a key feature for enabling seamless communication between different agents. Finally, you'll see how to deploy your agents to a scalable, fully managed environment with **Agent Engine**.

## Workshop Objectives
In this workshop, you will learn to:

* **Install** and configure the ADK environment.
* **Understand** the fundamental concepts of ADK and its project structure.
* **Equip** agents with tools, including pre-built tools like Google Search and LangChain tools, and create custom tools from Python functions.
* **Integrate** with external services using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, acting as both an MCP client and server.
* **Utilize** the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** for complex communication between agents.
* **Build** multi-agent systems by defining relationships between agents and managing their interaction.
* **Orchestrate** complex agent workflows using dedicated workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop).
* **Deploy** your agents to **Agent Engine** for a scalable, production-ready environment.
